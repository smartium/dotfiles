# PulseAudio Control

A feature-full volume control module for PulseAudio. Also known as Pavolume. Main features:

* Increase/Decrease and Mute the default sink's audio.
* Switch between sinks easily. You can also blacklist useless devices.
* Optionally enable notifications and OSD messages.
* Works as a shortcut to pavucontrol or your favorite audio manager tool.
* Highly customizable: check the [Usage](#usage) section for details.

## Installation

### Arch

Install [`pulseaudio-control`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/pulseaudio-control/) from the AUR with your preferred method, for example:
```
$ yay -S pulseaudio-control
```

### Other Linux

Download the [bash script](https://github.com/marioortizmanero/polybar-pulseaudio-control/blob/master/pulseaudio-control.bash) from this repository, or extract it from [the latest release](https://github.com/marioortizmanero/polybar-pulseaudio-control/releases/latest), and put it somewhere in your `$PATH`.

#### Dependencies

[`pulseaudio`](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/PulseAudio/) with `pactl` and `pacmd` in your `$PATH`. You might want to have [`pavucontrol`](https://freedesktop.org/software/pulseaudio/pavucontrol/) installed to easily control pulseaudio with a GUI. The script can send notifications if enabled, for which you'll need a notification daemon like [`dunst`](https://github.com/dunst-project/dunst).

To be able to switch the default sinks from this script you might need to disable stream target device restore by editing the corresponing line in `/etc/pulse/default.pa` to:

```
load-module module-stream-restore restore_device=false
```

At a minimum, bash version 4 is required to run the script. You can check your bash version by running `bash --version`.


## Usage

`polybar-pulseaudio-control` is expected to be invoked from a [polybar](//github.com/polybar/polybar) module:
```ini
[module/pulseaudio-control]
type = custom/script
exec = polybar-pulseaudio-control [option...] <action>
```

where `action`, and (optionally) `option`s are as specified in `polybar-pulseaudio-control help`:

```

See the [Module](#module) section for an example, or the [Useful icons](#useful-icons) section for some packs of icons.


## Module

The example from the screenshot can:

* Increase and decrease the volume on mousewheel scroll
* Mute the audio on left click
* Switch between devices on mousewheel click
* Open `pavucontrol` on right click

```ini
[module/pulseaudio-control]
type = custom/script
tail = true
format-underline = ${colors.cyan}
label-padding = 2
label-foreground = ${colors.foreground}

# Icons mixed from Font Awesome 5 and Material Icons
# You can copy-paste your options for each possible action, which is more
# trouble-free but repetitive, or apply only the relevant ones (for example
# --sink-blacklist is only needed for next-sink).
exec = pulseaudio-control --icons-volume "ÔÄß ,ÔÄ® " --icon-muted "ÔÄ¶ " --sink-nicknames-from "device.description" --sink-nickname "alsa_output.pci-0000_00_1b.0.analog-stereo:Óå≠  Speakers" --sink-nickname "alsa_output.usb-Kingston_HyperX_Virtual_Surround_Sound_00000000-00.analog-stereo:Óåê  Headphones" listen
click-right = exec pavucontrol &
click-left = pulseaudio-control togmute
click-middle = pulseaudio-control --sink-blacklist "alsa_output.pci-0000_01_00.1.hdmi-stereo-extra2" next-sink
scroll-up = pulseaudio-control --volume-max 130 up
scroll-down = pulseaudio-control --volume-max 130 down
```

## Useful icons

Here's a list with some icons from different fonts you can copy-paste. Most have an space afterwards so that the module has a bit of spacing. They may appear bugged on your browser if the font isn't available there. Please add yours if they aren't in the list.

| Font name                                       | Volumes         | Muted   | Sink icons                 |
| ----------------------------------------------- | :-------------: | :-----: | :------------------------: |
| [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com)          | `"ÔÄß ,ÔÄ® "`       | `"ÔÄ¶ "`  | `"Óå≠ "` or `"Óåê "`           |
| [Material](https://material.io/resources/icons) | `"ÓÅé ,ÓÅç ,ÓÅê "`    | `"ÓÅè "`  | `"Óå≠ "` or `"ÓåÆ "` or `"Óåê "` |
| Emoji                                           | `"üîà ,üîâ ,üîä "` | `"üîá "` | `"üîà "` or `"üéß "`         |
| Emoji v2                                        | `"üï® ,üï© ,üï™ "`    | `"üîá "` | `"üï® "` or `"üéß "`          |

Most of these can be used after downloading a [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) and including it in your [Polybar config](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/wiki/Fonts). For example:

```ini
font-X = Font Awesome 5 Free: style=Solid: pixelsize=11
font-Y = Font Awesome 5 Brands: pixelsize=11
font-Z = Material Icons: style=Regular: pixelsize=13; 2
```

## Sources

Part of the script and of this README's info was taken from [customlinux.blogspot.com](http://customlinux.blogspot.com/2013/02/pavolumesh-control-active-sink-volume.html), the creator. It was later adapted to fit polybar. It is also mixed with [the ArcoLinux version](https://github.com/arcolinux/arcolinux-polybar/blob/master/etc/skel/.config/polybar/scripts/pavolume.sh), which implemented the `listen` action to use less resources.
